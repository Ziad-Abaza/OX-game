# Tic Tac Toe Game

This repository contains the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game where players can play with each other. The game allows a two-player mode with automated smart moves for player 'O'.

## Features

- **Player 'X' and Player 'O' gameplay**: Players take turns marking their moves in the grid.
- **Automatic moves for 'O'**: The 'O' player makes moves based on a simple strategy that aims to block 'X' or win the game.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game checks for a winner after every move and announces the winner or a draw.
- **Grid-based Game**: A 3x3 grid with clickable squares.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The game will start with player 'X'.
3. Click on any square to place your move (X or O).
4. The game will continue until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the Tic Tac Toe grid and the game's title.
- `styles.css`: The styling file that defines the appearance of the game grid and the layout.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic including:
  - Player moves
  - Checking for the winner
  - Handling game over scenarios
